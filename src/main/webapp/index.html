        <h2>SCRUM Plan</h2>
        <h3>Sprint one (Friday 04/10 - Monday 07/10): </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The API description must be almost (we are using an iterative process) complete and available as a page on your deployed project.</li>
            <li>The SCRUM plan for the three mini-sprints must be available as a page on your deployed project. This can either be a copy of our suggestion below, or Sprint-1 as given below and your own plan for the remaining sprints if your “product owner” agrees (red students).</li>
            <li>The CI-pipeline must be setup</li>
            <li>Some of the Entity Classes and the Facade(s) must be ready with supplementing tests</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Sprint two (Tuesday 8/10 - Wednesday 9/10):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Most of the Entity Classes should be ready</li>
            <li>Sample data should be available in the dev-database</li>
            <li>Some of the endpoints (as a minimum a GET, POST and PUT) must be ready with the corresponding DTO’s and integrations tests</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Sprint three (Thursday 10/10- Sunday 13/10):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete the API (as much as you have time for)</li>
            <li>
                Implement a simple SPA which as a minimum must have the ability to use some of your GET endpoints and at least one POST endpoint. Consider pages like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Get all persons with a given hobby</li>
                    <li>Get all persons living in a given city (i.e. 2800 Lyngby)</li>
                    <li>Get the count of people with a given hobby</li>
                    <li>Get a list of all zip codes in Denmark</li>
                    <li>Get a list of companies with more than xx employes</li>
                    <li>Create a Person (with hobbies, phone, address etc.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Complete documentation and prepare for your review presentation after the holiday</li>
